This is a fork and current development version.
It is ALIVE! IT WORKS! (for me™)

## Known Issues
- Settings UI is broken, hidden for now
[Issue #6](https://github.com/wltjr/entrance/issues/6)

## About
Entrance is a Unix Display/Login Manager written in Enlightenment Foundation 
Libraries (EFL). Entrance allows a user to choose a X WM/Desktop 
session to launch upon successful login. Entrance is alive and working 
again for logging into X sessions and eventually Wayland sessions!

The project has been resurrected from the dead to live on once again...

## History
Entrance is a long story. There has been 2 different code bases and 
projects both using the name entrance.

### 1st Generation
There was a project long ago that worked, and went 
[MIA](http://xcomputerman.com/pages/entrance.html). Copies of the 
sources for some releases are in some distro repositories. A copy has 
been obtained via a PCLinuxOS src rpm. Ideally, it would be great to get a 
copy of the old entrance repo to add to this one for historical 
purposes. If you have a copy of the old Entrance repository, please 
open an issue and provide a link. That would be greatly appreciated!

### 2nd Generation 
Sometime later another came along,
[Michael Bouchaud](https://github.com/eyoz)/@eyoz who renamed his 
project elsa to Entrance, which is where the current code base came 
from. It is not known if this was ever completed or worked, but 
does not function correctly, if it is even usable to log in at all.

The broken, incomplete, unmaintained 2nd Generation Entrance 
resides in Enlightenment's 
[entrance git repository](https://git.enlightenment.org/misc/entrance.git/).
A branch may be added to this repository for historical purposes.

### 3rd Generation
This project is the 3rd generation, fork of the 2nd Generation code 
base, with a lot of fixes, and initial removal of incomplete and/or 
broken code. Rather than fix as is, we are looking to replace functionality 
with new code and finding different ways of accomplishing similar functionality.

This generation is currently in development, and should be usable.
Please open [issues](https://github.com/wltjr/entrance/issues) for any problems encountered. 

## Build
Entrance presently uses meson build system, autotools has been dropped. 

### Build using meson
```
prefix=/usr/share
meson \
	--prefix "${prefix}" \
	--bindir "${prefix}/bin" \
	--sbindir "${prefix}/sbin" \
	--datadir "${prefix}/share" \
	--sysconfdir "/etc" \
	. build
ninja -C build
```

On most systems you likely need a pam file. Meson will install this file.
```
cp data/entrance.pam.d /etc/pam.d/entrance
```

The systemd service file is presently not installed. It may or may not 
be usable and/or correct. Please see the section on logind/elogind for 
further information.

## Configuration
Most things can be configured in entrance.conf at `/etc/entrance/entrance.conf`.
Some settings may not work. Please file issues for anything that is not 
configurable or does not work.

## Usage
In order to start entrance, you need a system init script or systemd (untested). 
This may differ based on your operating system. Entrance does not 
provide an init script at this time, it may not run or work correctly if started 
directly. Entrance should be invoked via init script or systemd service. 
There is a provided systemd service file for entrance. It is unknown if 
this works or not.

### Entrance User
Entrance presently starts as root, and then, uses setuid to run entrance_client 
under the user nobody. This was done via sudo and su for a bit before 
switching to setuid. Entrance also used to run under the "entrance" user but 
was changed in this [past commit](https://git.enlightenment.org/misc/entrance.git/commit/?id=866fdf557acbfbf1f2404da9c3799020375c16d2).
Inherited design from the 2nd generation.

It may be changed such that entrance runs under its own user, and does 
not setuid or run under root. This will require creation of a user 
account and adding permissions for the user for video, etc. It may be 
possible to accomplish this now, starting entrance under a user say 
"entrance" by modifying the untested entrance.conf `start_user` 
option:
```
value "start_user" string: "entrance";
```

You will likely also need to create a directory for entrance, and ensure 
it has proper permissions. Since entrance will not be running under root,
entrance will not be able to correct this, despite having code for such.
Expect to see some errors in log file otherwise, along with non-functional
entrance. If started as root, entrance will create directories with proper 
permissions as needed.

### Multiple Displays
Entrance supports multiple displays, with the login form residing on the 
primary display. In some cases this does not work correctly. If using X, 
you may need to set the following settings in your monitor sections.
```
Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"A"
	Option		"position"	"0 0"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"B"
	Option		"LeftOf"	"A"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"C"
	Option		"RightOf"	"A"
EndSection
```
Without such, only the background will appear. The login form will not 
appear along with the rest of the UI, and the cursor will be an X. This  
likely due to bugs in entrance code. The work around is the previously 
mentioned monitors section.

## logind/elogind aka systemd
Presently not supported beyond build systems, no code written, just a 
service file. There are plans to support logind/elogind for Wayland and 
X via D-Bus. Initial work is currently under way. No code has been committed
yet. There is no ETA at this time for completion.
